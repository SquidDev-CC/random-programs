$7The SwitchCraft cipher challenge is a competition
where one races to decipher some encrypted text.

We'll periodically release a new challenge, with
$1rewards$7 for whoever breaks the code the quickest.

To get started, stand on the pad on the right
and insert a disk, pocket computer or neural
interface into the drive. We'll copy the latest
challenge across.

Once you've decoded the first challenge, it'll
include instructions on how to submit. It's a fairly
trivial cipher this week, so now'd be a good time
to look through some of the classics.


We're currently on $5Challenge #%[challenge].
