# Random programs

This is a collection of tiny programs for ComputerCraft/CC:Tweaked that do not deserve their own repository. They're
generally not actively maintained, but might be useful as a reference to people.

 - `ciper/`: This was a small POC project to provide a little codebreaking challenge to a server. Players would insert a
   pocket computer, receive a weekly challenge, and then race to solve it. I never had time to actually run the
   challenge, so while this is functional, it's never been used.

 - `lua-git/`: This is tiny `git clone --depth=1` implementation. It supports cloning any remote git repository, though
   only stores files - metadata is not stored anywhere.

 - `error-fix.lua`: Overrides metatables to remove most sources of errors from programs. Well, sort of.

 - `ore3d.lua`: A 3d ore scanning program for Plethora.

 - `zeromini-palette.lua`: My custom palette for ComputerCraft.
